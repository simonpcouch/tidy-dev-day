# Setup

## Size and setup

* 30 URM, 30 general addmision, 20 helpers feels good. 
* 1:3 helper:participant ratio was definitely spot on.

## Issue triage

* Every target issue needs to be labelled with the tidy-dev-day label.
  Can see current list at  <https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+label%3A%22tidy-dev-day+%3Anerd_face%3A%22>.

* Ideally need 1-2 issues for each participant.

* Weight towards documentation issues as they are generally simple wins and a good place to start for new contributors.

## Labels

* Each issue becomes a label (how?)

* Each label is stuck on a post-it: yellow = doc, red = bug, green = feature.

* Make some large labels to group related issues (e.g. ggplot2, r-lib) on the wall.

## Icebreaker

* `opening.key` introduces "The blame game," where participants are given some details about a PR like the repo, year, PR title, and a snippet of the description and try to guess who the author of the PR is.

* PRs are mostly from ggplot2, dplyr, and usethis, with some additions from elsewhere in r-lib, tidyverse, tidymodels, and rstudio, and demonstrate either functionality folks might be familiar with (e.g. the PR that added `geom_violin()` to ggplot2) or the kind of task participants will do that day (e.g. edit documentation).

* Current version is [on Quizizz](https://quizizz.com/admin/quiz/66aa502b82b6a030cb418ab2), and Simon, Mine, and Hadley have author permissions.

    + The platform is pretty eager when it comes to playing sounds; be sure to turn off audio when starting up the game and tell participants to do so as well.
